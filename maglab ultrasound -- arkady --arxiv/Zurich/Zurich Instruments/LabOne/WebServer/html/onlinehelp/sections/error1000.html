  <p>
    Sorry, the connection to the data server was lost. As the session state is still valid, all the session data including device settings has been saved to a file with name 'last_session_[file-name]' where file-name is the last loaded settings file.
  </p>
  <h2>Cases that may trigger this failure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A user closed the data server application</li>
    <li>The data server runs on a different computer and network connection was lost.</li>
    <li>The data server could not handle an error and was closed.</li>
  </ul>
