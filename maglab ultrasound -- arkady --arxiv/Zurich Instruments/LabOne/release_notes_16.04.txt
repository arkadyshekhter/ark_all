1. NOTES
========

Firmware Update for UHF Devices

The v16.04 release requires a manual firmware update for UHF devices. Please follow the
instructions in the document http://www.zhinst.com/downloads/ziUHFLI_FirmwareUpgrade_16.04.pdf.
The HF2 and MFLI devices do not need any manual firmware update as the firmware is downloaded
automatically as soon as the device is connected after software installation.


2. DRIVER INSTALLATION
======================

When prompted by Windows for driver installation, tell Windows to _not_ look for new drivers on "Windows Update"
and tell it to "automatically install drivers".


Update LabVIEW driver

It is important to update the LabVIEW driver separately. After updating LabOne, you will find a new
version of the LabVIEW API in Program Files\Zurich Instruments\LabOne\API\LabVIEW. Copy the folder
"Zurich Instruments" to, i.e., C:\Program Files\National Instruments\Labview 2012\inst.lib\ and restart LabVIEW.

+ Lock-in: Support of edge and gating triggers
+ Aux: Automatic adjustment of Preoffset and Offset to zero outputs
+ Sweep: Additional sweep parameters
+ PLL: Center point adjustment for PLL
+ UI: up/down arrows for fast increase/decrease of values
+ SW Trigger: Triggering on Ref/Trigger lines
+ Spectrum: Higher number of samples for FFT spectrum to suppress windowing effects
* Spectrum: ZoomFFT renamed to Spectrum
* Spectrum: Spectral density and power calculation on FFT spectrum
* Num: Increased font size for numerical values
* Lock-in: To nearest value rounding of sampling rate
* Scope: Improved triggering if dual edge trigger is enabled
* Scope: Scope and FFT are now integrated on a single tab
* PID: simultaneous operation of all 4 controllers at a rate of 14 MSa/s
* Plotter: Fix of plotter data shifting artefacts
* Sweep: Improved sweep speed and support for odd configurations
* UI: Unified directory structure for both Matlab and CSV data saving
* UI: Improved design and drag & drop functionality for tabs
* UI: Improved stability of zoom/autoscaling for extreme limits
* UI: Chaining is only applied once and transfers last changed value (solves update storms)
- UI: SVG saving of dual plots only saves the lower plot
- Lock-in: Aux In 2 disappears
- SW Trigger: Returns twice the data for subsequent 'execute'

API
+ Timestamp support on double and integer values (API4 mode)
+ LabVIEW 64-bit support
+ Added hwtrigger field to the demod sample structure (lowest 4bits for the trigger lines)
+ Added PWA data type to APIs
* Clean-up of ziAPI.h
* Improved examples running on all device types
! LabView: hwtrigger not available in sample data
! LabView: PWA data type not available (no API4 level support)

# Removed /DEV*/STATS/USB/*
# Renamed /DEV*/SYSTEM/NICS/* to /DEV*/SYSTEM/NICS/0/*
# Added   /DEV*/CONN/ACTIVEINTERFACE
# Added   /DEV*/SYSTEM/NICS/0/JUMBO
# Added   /DEV*/SYSTEM/FWLOG
# Added   /DEV*/SYSTEM/FWLOGENABLE
# Added   /DEV*/STATS/PHYSICAL/FANSPEED
# Removed /DEV*/SYSTEM/NICS/SAVEMAC



SUMMARY OF CHANGES 13.06
========================

UHFLI
+ Number of demodulators increased from 6 to 8
+ Auto re-calibrate after 20 minutes warmup
* External reference moved from demodulator 7 to 4
* Default output enable moved from demodulator 7 to 4
* Several bug fixes and improvements in MOD option
* Increased network stability and reconnect behavior
* Improved Ext Ref performance
* PLL/PID: increased max bandwidth

LabOne UI
+ One-click start of LabOne GUI
+ Sweeper: added Bode plot
+ Sweeper: measurements referencing against saved data / history
+ Save/Load Settings feature fully supported
* Renaming of servers (LabOne Data Server and LabOne Web Server)
* General improvement of look and feel
* Lock-in: major improvements on Lock-In tab
* Improved status bar
* Stability and performance improvements on Sweeper, ZoomFFT, and SW Trigger

* Many PID/PLL enhancements
* External reference support on Ref / Trigger inputs
* Auto-range on Signal Output
+ Auto-zero phase adjustment

LabOne UI
* Improved look and feel
+ Persistence mode on scope
+ Sweeper, SW Trigger: Select waves to display and individually set colors or names
* Stability and performance improvements on Sweeper, ZoomFFT, and SW Trigger
* Additional functionality on Numerical Tab
+ Averaging on FFT and ZoomFFT
+ Unit support
+ Command log added
