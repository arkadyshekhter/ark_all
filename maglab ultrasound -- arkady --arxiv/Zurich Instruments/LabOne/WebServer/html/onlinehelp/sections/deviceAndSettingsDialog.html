  <h1 id="helpSessionDialogue">Starting a Session with the LabOne User Interface</h1>

  <p>
    This section explains how to start working with a device in the LabOne User Interface.
  </p>

  <h2 id="deviceAndSettingsDialog">Device And Settings Dialog</h2>
  <p>Upon starting the LabOne User Interface a dialog is shown to select the device and settings to use.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="onlinehelp/img/discovery_UHF_local.png" alt="Dialog Device and Settings" />
    <figcaption>Dialog Device and Settings</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The term session is used for an active connection between the user interface and the
          device. Such a session is defined by device-specific and user interface settings. Several
          sessions can be started in parallel. The sessions run on a shared LabOne Web Server. A
  detailed description of the software architecture can be found in section <a href="#softwareArchitecture">Software Architecture</a>.</p>

  <p>The Device and Settings dialog consists of four sections: Web Server Connectivity, Data Server Connectivity,
  Available Devices, and Saved Settings. By default, the dialog is set to Local Data Server mode in the Available
  Devices section. In that case, the list of Available Devices will contain all instruments directly connected to the
  host PC via USB or to the local network via 1GbE. Once your instrument appears in the Available Devices section,
  perform the following steps to start a new session:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Select an instrument in the Available Devices list.</li>
    <li>Select a setting file unless the <em>Default &amp; UI</em> is used.</li>
    <li>Start the session by pressing <em>Device &amp; UI</em>, <em>UI Only</em>, or <em>Default UI</em>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p></p>
  <p>If there are no setting files listed starting the LabOne User Interface by pressing the button <em>Default UI</em> will start a session using factory defaults.</p>

  <div class="note">
    <label>Note</label>
    <p>Opening a new session with the <em>Device &amp; UI</em> button can affect existing sessions since the device settings are
    shared between them. In that case, consider using the <em>UI Only</em> button to open a new session.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <label>Note</label>
    <p>In case devices from multiple Zurich Instruments series (HF2, UHF) are used in parallel, the list of Available
    Devices section can contain those as well.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>The following sections describe the steps in detail. If failures are detected further dialogs are shown.</p>



  <h3 id="deviceAndSettingsDialog.server">Server Connectivity</h3>

  <p>The Device and Settings dialog represents a Web Server shown under Web Server Connectivity. However, on startup the
  Web Server is not yet connected to a LabOne Data Server, which is why the fields under Data Server Connectivity are
  empty. With the <em>Connect/Disconnect</em> button the connection to a Data Server can be opened and closed. This
  functionality can usually be ignored when working with a single instrument and a single host computer. The
  functionality is important for users working with several instruments, possibly even from different Zurich Instruments
  series (MF, HF2). The Data Server Connectivity function then gives the freedom to connect the Web Server to one of
  several accessible Data Servers. This includes Data Servers running on remote computers controlling UHF or HF2 series
  instruments, and also Data Servers running on an MFLI instrument.</p>

  <div class="note">
    <label>Note</label>
    <p>When using All Data Servers mode, take great care to connect to the right instrument especially in larger local
    networks. Always identify your instrument based on its device serial of the form DEV-XXXX which can be found on the
    instrument back panel.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3 id="deviceAndSettingsDialog.device">Available Devices</h3>

  <p>The Available Devices section gives an overview of the visible devices. A device is ready for use if either marked
  free or connected. The first column of the list holds the <em>Enable</em> button controlling the connection between
  the device and a Data Server. This button is greyed out until a Data Server is connected to the LabOne Web Server
  using the <em>Connect</em> button. If the button is enabled the device is connected by the LabOne Data Server. In this
  case no other LabOne Data Server running on another PC can access the device. Only one interface and LabOne Data
  Server can access the device.</p>

  <p>The second column indicates the device serial and the third column shows the instrument type (HF2, UHF, or
  MFLI). The fourth column indicates shows the IP address of the LabOne Data Server controlling the device, if it is not
  a local one. The next column shows the interface type. For UHF series instruments the interfaces USB, 1GbE, or 10GbE
  are available. The interface is listed if physically connected. The LabOne Data Server will scan for the available
  devices and interfaces every second. If a device has just been switched on or physically connected it may take up to
  20s before it becomes visible to the LabOne Data Server. If an interface is physically connected but not visible
  please read <a href="#deviceConnectivity">Device Connectivity</a>.</p>

  <p>The last column indicates the status of the device. <a href="#deviceAndSettingsDialog.device.status">Device Status
  and Information</a> explains the meaning of the possible device status information.</p>

  <h4 id="deviceAndSettingsDialog.device.status">Device Status</h4>
  <p>The following table explains the meaning of the possible device status information.</p>
  <table class="description">

  <td>Free</td>
  <td>The device is not in use by any LabOne Data Server and can be connected by clicking the <em>Enable</em>
  button. Alternatively, a session can also be started by clicking on <em>Device &amp; UI</em>, <em>UI Only</em>, or
  <em>Default UI</em> without prior connection.</td>
      </tr>
    <tr>
  <td>In Use</td>
  <td>The device is in use by a LabOne Data Server. As a consequence the device cannot be accessed by the specified interface. To access the device a disconnect is needed.</td>
      </tr>
    <tr>
  <td>Connected</td>
  <td>The device is connected to a LabOne Data Server, either on the same PC (indicated as local) or on a remote PC
  (indicated by its IP address). The user can start a session to work with that device.</td>
      </tr>
    <tr>

  </table>

  <h4>Messages</h4>
  <p>The LabOne Web Server will show additional messages in case of a missing component or a failure condition. These messages display information about the failure condition. The following paragraphs list these messages and give more information on the user actions needed to solve the problem.</p>
  <h5>Lost Connection to the LabOne Web Server</h5>
  <p>In this case the browser is no longer able to connect to the LabOne Web Server. This can happen if the Web Server and Data Server run on different PCs and a network connection is shortly interrupted. As long as the Web Server is running and the session did not yet time out, it is possible to just attach to the existing session and continue. Thus, within about 15 seconds it is possible with Retry to recover the old session connection. The button <em>Reload</em> will open the standard <a href="#deviceAndSettingsDialog">Dialog Device and Settings</a>. An example of the dialog is shown below.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="onlinehelp/img/connect_dialog_connection_lost_to_webserver.png" alt="Dialog Connection Lost" />
    <figcaption>Dialog Connection Lost</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <h5>Reloading...</h5>
  <p>If a session error cannot be handled the LabOne Web Server will restart and present a new standard <a href="#deviceAndSettingsDialog">Dialog Device and Settings</a>. During the restart a window will be displayed indicating that the LabOne User Interface will reload. If the reloading does not happen the same effect can be triggered by pressing F5 on the browser window. The figure below shows an example of this dialog.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="onlinehelp/img/connect_dialog_reloading.png" alt="Dialog Reloading" />
    <figcaption id="reloadingDialog">Dialog Reloading</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <h5 id="noDevicesDiscovered.device.messages">No Device Discovered</h5>
  <p>An empty "Available Devices" list means that no devices were discovered. This can mean that no
LabOne Data Server is running, or that it is running but failed to detect any devices. The device may
be switched off or the interface connection fails. For more information on the interface between
device and PC see <a href="#deviceConnectivity">Device Connectivity</a>.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="onlinehelp/img/discovery_noDevice_local.png" alt="Message No Device Available" />
    <figcaption>No Device Discovered</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <h5 id="noDevicesAvailable.device.messages">No device Available</h5>
  <p>If all the devices in the "Available Devices" list are shown grayed, this indicates that all devices are either in use by another Data Server, or need a firmware upgrade. See section <a href="#firmwareUpgrade">Upgrading the Lock-In Amplifier Firmware</a>. If all the devices are in use by another Data server, access is not possible until a connection is relinquished by the other Data Server.
  </p>
  <p>Since the session requires an active connection, the start buttons are inactive.</p>
  <h5 id="firmwareUpgradeNeeded.device.messages">Device firmware upgrade needed</h5>
  <p>If a UHF instrument needs a firmware upgrade, see section <a href="#firmwareUpgrade">Upgrading the Lock-In Amplifier Firmware</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="deviceAndSettingsDialog.settings">Saved Settings</h3>
  <p></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="onlinehelp/img/discovery_UHF_manyDevices.png" alt="Dialog Device and Settings" />
    <figcaption>Dialog Device and Settings</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Settings files can contain both UI and device settings. UI settings control the structure of the LabOne User Interface e.g. the opened tabs. Device settings specify the set-up of a device. The device settings will persist on the device until the next power off or until overwritten by loading another settings file.</p>
  <p>The meaning of the columns are described in the following section. The table rows can be sorted by clicking on the column header that should be sorted. The default sorting is by time. Therefore, the most recent settings are found on top. Sorting the favorite marker or setting file name may be useful as well.</p>
  <h4>Column Descriptions</h4>
  <table class="description">
    <colgroup>
      <col style="width:15%"></col>
      <col style="width:85%"></col>
    </colgroup>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Star:</td> <td>Allows favorite settings files to be grouped together. By activating the stars adjacent to a settings files and clicking on the column heading, the chosen files will be grouped together at the top or bottom of the list accordingly. Subsequent clicks will toggle between the top and bottom of the list. The favorite marker is saved to the file. If the LabOne user interface is started next time, the row will be marked as favorite again.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Name:</td> <td>The name of the settings file. In the file system, the file name has the extension .xml.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Date:</td> <td>The date and time the settings file was last written.</td>
      </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Comment:</td> <td>Allows a comment to be stored in the settings file. By clicking on the comment field a text can be typed in which is subsequently stored in the settings file. This comment is very useful to describe the specific conditions of a measurement. The comment can be added at any time.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <h4>Special Settings Files</h4>
    <p>Certain file names can be observed with the prefix "last_session_". Such files are created automatically by the web server when a session is terminated either explicitly by the user, or under critical error conditions, and save the current UI and device settings. The prefix is prepended to the name of the most recently used settings file. This allows any unsaved changes to be recovered upon starting a new session.</p>
  <p>If a user loads such a last session setting file the "last_session_" prefix will be cut away from the file name. Otherwise, there is a risk that an auto-save will overwrite a setting which was saved explicitly by the user.</p>
    <p>The settings file with the name "default_ui" also has special meaning. As the name suggests this file contains the default UI settings. See button description below.</p>

  <h3>Button Descriptions</h3>
  <table class="description">
    <colgroup>
      <col style="width:15%"></col>
      <col style="width:85%"></col>

  <div class="note">
    <label>Note</label>
    <p>The default UI settings can be customized by saving a file with the name "default_ui" in the Config tab once the LabOne session has been started and the desired UI setup has been established. If a "default_ui" setting file exists pressing the button <em>Default UI</em> will load it instead of the factory default. To use factory defaults again, the "default_ui" file must be removed from the user setting directory.</p>

  <h1 id="helpUHF">Controlling the Zurich Instruments UHFLI Lock-in Amplifier from the PC</h1>
  <!-- TODO UHFLI intro-->
  <p>Your Zurich Instruments lock-in amplifier can be accessed by several software clients simultaneously (LabOne User
      Interface clients and/or API clients), and also by several users accessing the same device
      from different computers. All clients access the instrument by means of the "LabOne Data
      Server UHF" program, a dedicated server that is in charge of all communication to and from the
      device.</p>
<p></p>
    <h1 id="softwareArchitecture">LabOne Software Architecture</h1>
  <p>The LabOne User Interface is part of the LabOne software distribution which enables device control. This chapter gives a brief overview on the software architecture.</p>
  <p>The software of Zurich Instruments lock-in amplifiers is server based. This allows for multiple clients to access devices with synchronized settings.</p>
  <p>The Zurich Instruments LabOne software is organized in layers.</p>
    <h2>LabOne Software Layers</h2>
  <p>An overview of the software layers is shown in Figure <a href="#figure.softwareArchitecture">Software Architecture</a>.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="onlinehelp/img/software_architecture.svg" alt="Software Architecture" />
    <figcaption id="figure.softwareArchitecture">Software architecture</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Each device is internally controlled by firmware (FW). If a software release offers
          new device functionality the device firmware may need an upgrade as well. Upgrading the
          firmware is described in detail in section <a href="#firmwareUpgrade">Upgrading the Lock-In Amplifier Firmware</a>.</p>
  <p>The lowest layer running on the PC is the LabOne Data Server which is the interface
          to all the connected lock-in amplifiers. The middle layer consists of a LabOne Web Server
          which is the server for the web-browser-based LabOne User Interface. In addition to a user
          interface the device can be controlled by custom software or other applications over the
          API layer. The following sections explain the different layers and their functionality in
          more detail.</p>
  <h3>LabOne Data Server</h3>
  <p>The LabOne Data Server can control a single or also multiple lock-in amplifiers. The devices are connected
            over USB or Ethernet interfaces. An Ethernet connection to the instrument uses always both a TCP and UDP
            connection. The UDP connection will transmit the high bandwidth data as for instance demodulator samples or
            scope data. The LabOne Data Server will distribute the measurement data to all the clients that subscribe to
            it. It also ensures that settings changed by one client are transferred to other clients. The device
            settings are therefore synchronized on all clients. On a PC only one single instance of a LabOne Data Server
            should be started. If the server is configured to listen to other IP addresses than localhost it is possible
            to access measurement data from a different PC. The data access to the device must always be performed over
            the LabOne Data Server.</p>
  <h3>LabOne Web Server</h3>
  <p>The LabOne Web Server is an application dedicated to serving up the web pages that constitute the LabOne
            user interface. The LabOne Web Server supports multiple clients simultaneously. That is to say that more
            than one session can be used to view data and manipulate the instrument. A session could be running in a tab
            in a browser on the PC on which the LabOne software is installed. It could equally well be running in a tab
            of a browser on a remote machine. The user interface is touch enabled. Therefore, it is possible to use the
            LabOne User Interface on a mobile device like a tablet. The measurement data of the instrument can be viewed
            remotely from any device that has a browser and has access to the Web Server via the LAN. To connect the
            instrument, the user simply has to type the IP address or domain name of the computer running the LabOne web
            server together with the port number 8006.
     Examples are given below.<br /><br /><code>127.0.0.1:8006<br />localhost:8006<br />myPC.company.com:8006</code>
  </p>
  <p>The most recent versions of the most popular browsers are supported: Chrome, Internet Explorer, Opera, Firefox and Safari.</p>
  <h3>LabOne API Layer</h3>
  <p>The lock-in amplifier can also be controlled via one or more of the Zurich Instruments
            provided APIs. APIs are currently provided in the form of DLLs for the following
            programming environments:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>MatLab</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>LabView</li>
        <li>C API</li>
    </ul>
  <p>The instrument can therefore be controlled by an external program and the resulting data directly
            processed. The device can be concurrently accessed via one or more of the APIs and via the user interface.
            This enables easy integration into larger laboratory setups. See the LabOne programming manual for further
            information.
  </p>
    <p>Using the APIs, the programmer has access to the same functionality that is available in the LabOne user interface.</p>
  <p></p>


  <h2>Controlling the Instrument via the LabOne User Interface</h2>

  <p>This section describes the LabOne User Interface startup. If the LabOne Software is not yet installed on the PC
  please follow the instructions in user manual chapter Software Installation. If the device is not yet connected by USB
  or Ethernet please find more information in section <a href="#deviceConnectivity">Device Connectivity</a>.</p>

  <p>The most straightforward method to control and obtain data from the instrument is to use the LabOne User Interface,
  which can be found under the Windows Start Menu <a href="#figureStartMenuWindows7">Windows 7 Start Menu</a> and <a
  href="#figureStartMenuWindows10">Windows 10 Start Menu</a>: Click and select Start Menu &#8594; All programs / All
  apps &#8594; Zurich Instruments &#8594; LabOne User Interface. This will open the User Interface in a new tab in your
  default web browser and start the LabOne Data Server and LabOne Web Server programs in the background. A detailed
  description of the software structure is found in the section <a href="#softwareArchitecture">LabOne Software
  Architecture</a>.</p>

  <p>
    The LabOne User Interface is an HTML5 browser-based program. This simply means that the user interface runs in a web
    browser and that a connection using a mobile device is also possible; simply specify the IP address (and port 8006)
    of the PC running the user interface.
  </p>

  <div class="note">
    <label>Note</label>
    <p>The user interface requires a so-called LabOne Web Server (that runs in combination with the
LabOne Data Server). Instead of starting the user interface directly in your default browser as
described above, it's possible to start the LabOne Data Server UHF and LabOne Web Server
programs independently and then connect via a browser of your choice:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>First start the LabOne Data Server UHF and then the LabOne Web Server program. On Windows 7 click and
      select Start Menu &#8594; Programs &#8594; Zurich Instruments &#8594; LabOne Servers &#8594; LabOne Data Server
      UHF and Start Menu &#8594; Programs &#8594; Zurich Instruments &#8594; LabOne Servers &#8594; LabOne Web
      Server. On Windows 10, you click and select Start Menu &#8594; All Apps &#8594; Zurich Instruments &#8594; LabOne
      Data Server &#8594; LabOne Data Server UHF and Start Menu &#8594; Programs &#8594; Zurich Instruments &#8594;
      LabOne Servers &#8594; LabOne Web Server.
      </li>
      <li>In a web browser of your choice start the LabOne User Interface (graphical user interface) by
  entering the localhost address on port 8006: 127.0.0.1:8006
      </li>
    </ol>

  <h1 id="deviceConnectivity">Device Connectivity</h1>

  <p>There are several ways to connect to the Zurich Instruments lock-in amplifier from a host computer. The device can either be connected by Universal Serial Bus (USB) or by Ethernet. The USB connection is a point to point connection between the device and the PC on which the ziDataServer runs. The Ethernet connection can be a point to point connection or an integration of the device into the global network (LAN). Depending on the network configuration and the installed network card, one or the other connectivity is better suited. This section gives a brief introduction to different methods.</p>

  <p>If a device is connected to a network multiple PCs can access the same device. However,
        there is no shared device access possible at the same time. To control the access to a
        device two different connectivity states are needed: visible and connected.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="onlinehelp/img/connectivity.svg" alt="Connectivity" />
    <figcaption>Connectivity</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Figure Connectivity shows some examples of possible configurations of PC to device connectivity.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Server on PC 1 is connected to device 1 (USB) and device 2 (USB).</li>
    <li>Server on PC 2 is connected to device 4 (TCP/IP).</li>
    <li>Server on PC 3 is connected to device 5.</li>
    <li>The device 3 is free and visible for PC 1 and PC 2 over TCP/IP.</li>
    <li>Both device 2 and device 4 are accessible by TCP/IP and USB interface. Only one interface is logically connected to the server.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is important to distinguish if a device is just physically connected over USB or Ethernet or actively controlled be the LabOne Data Server. In the first case the device is visible to the LabOne Data Server. In the second case the device is connected (logically).</p>
  <h3>Visible Devices</h3>
  <p>A device is visible to the server if the server can identify the device. On a TCP/IP network several PCs running a server will detect the same device as visible. If a device is once discovered the server might initiate a connection to access the device and stream measurement data. Only one single connection is allowed at a time.</p>

  <h3>Connected Device</h3>
  <p>Once connected to a device, the Data Server has exclusive access to data of that
          device. If another Data Server from another PC already has an active connection to the
          device, the device is still visible but cannot be connected by a second PC.</p>
  <p>It should be note here that although a Data Server has exclusive access to a connected device,
          multiple browser and API client sessions still have simultaneous access and control over the device.
          Therefore changes made to the settings of a device by say a Python session via the programming API will be seen by a browser session connected to that device.
          The device data can be streamed to multiple client sessions simultaneously.
  </p>

  <h2 id="deviceConnectivity.USB">Universal Serial Bus (USB) Connection</h2>

  <p>In order to control the device over USB, connect the instrument with the supplied USB cable to the PC on which the LabOne Software is installed. The USB driver needed for controlling the device is included in the LabOne Installer package. Ensure that the device uses the latest firmware. The software will automatically use the USB interface for controlling the device if available. If the USB connection is not available the Ethernet connection may be selected. It is possible to enforce or exclude a specific interface connection.</p>

  <div class="note">

  <h2>Device Discovery USB</h2>
  <p>Devices connected over USB can be automatically connected by the Data Server as there is only a single host PC to which the device interface is physically connected.</p>
  <h3>auto-connect = on</h3>
    <p>This is the default behaviour. If a device is attached via a USB cable, a connection will be established automatically.</p>
  <!-- TODO(JS): Picture auto-connect on -->
  <h3>auto-connect = off</h3>
    <p>To disable automatic connection via USB, the following command line argument must be added when starting the Data Server: <code>--auto-connect=off</code></p>
    <p>This is achieved by right clicking the LabOne Data Server shortcut in the Start menu, selecting "Properties" and adding the text to the Target field as shown below.</p>

  <h2 id="deviceConnectivity.1GbE">Device Discovery TCP/IP 1GbE</h2>
  <p>Various methods are possible for connecting to the device via TCP/IP.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>multicast DHCP (simplest method)</li>
        <li>Multicast point to point (P2P)</li>
        <li>Static IP</li>
    </ul>

  <p>The sample transfer performance of different connections varies greatly. Generally it can be stated that a point-to-point connection will lead to larger transfer rates compared to a network-based connection at the expense of more complexity in the connection.</p>

  <p>For very high sample transfer rates, one must consider advanced network configurations that might be in contradiction with the local policies, e.g. the enabling of Jumbo frames.</p>

  </div>



  <h3 id="deviceConnectivity.1GbE.Multicast">Multicast DHCP</h3>
  <p>The most straightforward Ethernet connection method is to rely on a LAN configuration to recognize the UHF Instrument. By connecting the instrument in a LAN, a dynamic IP address will be assigned like any other PC by the DHCP server. In case of restricted networks, the network administrator may be required to register the device on the network by means of the MAC address. The MAC address is indicated on the back panel of the instrument. The Zurich Instruments software (LabOne Data Server) will detect the device in the network by means of a multicast.</p>
  <p>
    If the network configuration does not allow or does not support multicast, or the host computer has other network cards installed, it is necessary to use a static IP setup as described below. The UHF
Instrument is configured to accept the IP address from the DHCP server, or fallback into IP address 192.168.1.10 if it does not get the address from the DHCP server.

  <h3 id="deviceConnectivity.1GbE.MulticastP2P">Multicast Point to Point (P2P)</h3>
  <p>When you have two LAN cards installed in your host computer, one of which is used for network connectivity (e.g. internet), the other can be used for a direct connection to the UHF Instrument. Notebooks can generally profit from wireless LAN for network connectivity. It is important to note that if you set a static IP on your host computer you may lose the connection to the internet.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Use one of the network cards and set it to static IP in TCP/IPv4 using the following IP address and mask (go to Control Panel &#8594; Internet Options &#8594; Network and Internet &#8594; Network and Sharing Center &#8594; Local Area Connection &#8594; Properties). Note that the IP address of the PC should be 192.168.1.n, where n=[2..9] and the mask should be 255.255.255.0. The device itself will use the fallback address 192.168.1.10 if it doesn't get the address.

  <h2>Device Discovery TCP/IP 10GbE (UHF-10G)</h2>
  <p>The 10GbE interface is a hardware option UHF-10G for the Zurich Instruments UHFLI. It is possible to upgrade any UHFLI with this option.</p>
  <p>The UHF-10G option consists of following components.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>PCIe card 10 Gigabit XF SR Server Adapter</li>
    <li>Cisco X2-10GB-SR module</li>
    <li>5m multimode fiber optic patch cord</li>
    <li>10G option code <code>XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX</code></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Hardware Installation</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Install the PCIe card in the PC. The card must be inserted into a x8 or x16 PCIe slot.</li>
    <li>If the option is bought after delivery of the instrument: Turn the UHF device off and disconnect it from the power source. Unscrew the 10GbE cover. Carefully insert the module with the heat sink facing up. Make sure that the module is snapped in. A click should be noticeable.</li>
    <li>Remove the protectors from both ends of the fiber cable.</li>
    <li>Carefully connect the cable.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The physical link can be checked after programming the UHF-10G feature code as described in the next section.</p>

  <h3>Software Setup</h3>
  <p>The optical 10GbE interface is a point to point network. Therefore, the network card should be setup as explained in <a href="#deviceConnectivity.1GbE.MulticastP2P">Multicast Point to Point (P2P)</a>. The default 10GbE address is 192.168.2.10. Therefore, static IP of the PC should be selected 192.168.2.n with n=[2..9]. The network mask should be 255.255.255.0.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="onlinehelp/img/10g_ip_configuration.png" alt="10GbE IP Configuration" />
        <figcaption>10GbE IP configuration</figcaption>
      </figure>

  <p>The 10GbE network connection to the device creates high CPU load on the PC due to the high bandwidth of measurement data. It is thus essential that the network card is configured so that CPU load is optimized. The setting with highest impact is the enabling of Jumbo frames. Since the processor processes larger packages, the interrupt load will decrease. Therfore the 10GbE should always be used with Jumbo frames enabled. As the network is a P2P connection there is no side effect on other network devices.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="onlinehelp/img/advanced_10g_network_configuration.png" alt="Advanced 10GbE Network Card Configuration" />
        <figcaption>Advanced 10GbE network card configuration</figcaption>
      </figure>
  <p>The following settings should be configured on the network advanced 10GbE network card configuration.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Interrupt Moderation: Enabled</li>
    <li>Jumbo Packet: 9014 Bytes</li>
    <li>Large Send Offload (IPv4): Enabled</li>
    <li>Receive Side Scaling: Enabled</li>
    <li>Receive Side Scaling Queues: 4 Queues</li>
    <li>TCP/IP Offloading Options: All Enabled</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The device must have the UHF-10G option installed. The option key will be supplied when the option is bought. If the option is not yet installed at device delivery a USB or 1GbE connection is needed to the device to programm the UHF-10G option. The programming can be performed with the LabOne User Interface in the device tab. After option programming a device restart is needed. If the device is enabled, the UHF-10G option programmed, and the hardware installed, the link status can be checked in the Intel 10 Ggigabit XF SR Server Adapter Properties window by opening the sub tab Link Speed. The link status should be green at 10Gbps/Full Duplex.</p>

  <p>After device restart the 10GbE interface should be available in the <a href="#deviceAndSettingsDialog">Device And Settings Dialog</a>.</p>

  <div class="note">
    <label>Note</label>
    <p>If a 10GbE network card is enabled, the multicast will be sent over that interface. As a consequence other devices connected to the 1GbE network will not be visible anymore. The access the device over 1GbE the 10GbE interface should be temporarily disabled.</p>

  <h1 id="helpMF">Controlling the Zurich Instruments MFLI Lock-in Amplifier from the PC</h1>

    <h2 id="connectingtoMFLI">Connecting to the MFLI Instrument</h2>
    <p>The Zurich Instruments MFLI Lock-in Amplifier is designed to work out of the box with
        minimal effort on the part of the user. The Zurich Instruments LabOne software runs on an
        embedded PC in the MFLI instrument and is preinstalled before delivery. One of the programs
        running on the embedded PC is the LabOne Web Server, which can be connected to via a web
        browser once suitable physical and logical connections to the instrument have been
        established. There are two ways to physically connect to the instrument:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ethernet (no software installation required). Integrate the instrument into an
          existing local area network (LAN) by connecting the instrument to a switch in the LAN using
          an Ethernet cable. The instrument can then be accessed from a web browser running on any
          device in the same LAN. The Ethernet connection can also be point to point. This requires
          some adjustment of the network card settings of the client computer. Depending on the network configuration and the installed network card,
          one or the other connection scheme is better suited. The next sections give a brief
          introduction to the different connection methods.
      </li>
      <li>
        Universal Serial Bus (USB). The USB connection is a point to point connection between
          the instrument and the host computer to which the USB cable is connected. This requires
          the installation of an RNDIS driver on the host computer. The driver is conveniently available from the instrument's flash memory. Once the instrument is connected by USB to you PC/MAC a new drive appears in the Explorer/Finder that contains this driver and also the user manuals.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <figure id="ummfli.getting_started.connectivity">
      <img src="onlinehelp/img/connectivity_mfli.svg" alt="Connectivity"/>
      <figcaption id ="ummfli.getting_started.connectivity">Connectivity</figcaption>
     </figure>
    <p>Figure <a href="#ummfli.getting_started.connectivity">Connectivity</a> shows some examples of possible
      configurations of computer to instrument connectivity.</p>
    <h3>Ethernet TCP/IP Connection</h3>
      <p>The simplest connection method is to integrate the instrument into an existing LAN
        supporting the Domain Name System (DNS) and dynamic DNS update. In such a network the MFLI
        instrument can be addressed using its serial number instead of its IP address. Attach an
        Ethernet cable from the instrument to a LAN network switch. The LabOne User Interface can be
        started by typing the following text in the address bar of a web browser running on a
        computer in the LAN:</p>
      <p><code>http://&lt;instrument-serial>.&lt;domain>/</code>, or</p>
      <p><code>http://&lt;instrument-serial>/</code></p>
      <p>where <code>&lt;instrument-serial></code> is the serial number of the instrument and
          <code>&lt;domain></code> is the network domain in which the instrument is running.</p>
      <p>This approach uses DNS lookup to resolve the IP address of the instrument which is configured with this network
      name by default. It is possible that this approach fails due to special network policies or for other reasons. In
      that case, there are other options to configure the TCP/IP connection to the instrument. These are described in <a
      href="#ummfli.getting_started.deviceConnectivity.1GbE"> Instrument Discovery TCP/IP</a>.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that with connection via LAN, multiple web browser and API client
        sessions have simultaneous access and control over the instrument. Therefore changes made to
        the settings of the instrument by say a Python program via the programming API will be seen
        by a web browser session connected to that instrument. The instrument data can be streamed
        to multiple client sessions simultaneously. </p>

       </figure>
      <h3 id="ummfli.getting_started.deviceConnectivity.USB">Universal Serial Bus (USB) Connection</h3>
      <p>To control the instrument via USB, connect the instrument with the supplied USB cable to
        the PC you are using. Depending on the operating system you are using, it may be necessary
        to install a USB RNDIS device driver on the PC. The RNDIS provides a virtual Ethernet link
        to the instrument enabling it to be addressed using the normal IP address and host name
        mechanisms. The RNDIS driver installation procedure for various operating systems is
        described in the next sections.</p>
        <h4>USB RNDIS Device Driver Windows</h4>
        <p>Zurich Instruments provides a Microsoft MSI installer to simplify the Windows RNDIS driver installation. The
        MFLI Instrument is designed so that when the USB cable is plugged in, a flash disk partition appears with the
        label MFLI, containing the required Windows MSI installer for the USB RNDIS device driver, plus the instrument
        user manual in PDF form and a copy of the Getting Started booklet.</p>
        <p>Proceed with the device driver installation as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
           Log on to the PC as an administrator. Installing the USB RNDIS device driver
              requires administrator rights.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensure that the USB cable is connected from the PC to the MFLI Instrument.
          </li>
          <li>
            Power cycle the MFLI Instrument and wait for approximately 20 seconds for the
              instrument initialization to complete. During this time an AutoPlay window will pop up
              showing the newly detected MFLI drive.
          </li>
		  <li>In the AutoPlay window, select <em>Open folder to view files</em>.
		  <img src="onlinehelp/img/fig_explorer_mfli_installer.png" alt=""/><br/></li>
		  <li>Two installers will be visible in Windows Explorer: Double click on the .msi
            installer appropriate for your operating system. This will be either:<br/>

        <h4>USB RNDIS Device Driver Linux</h4>
        <p>With an up-to-date version of a UBUNTU Linux distribution there is no special
          installation necessary, the USB connection works out of the box.</p>
        <p>Other Linux distributions should also work but may require further installation steps.
          Detailed instructions cannot not given here due to the large number of Linux distributions
          available.</p>
        <h4>USB RNDIS Device Driver OS X</h4>
        <p>To install the required USB RNDIS device driver on a Macintosh computer, proceed as
          follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Open a web browser and go to http://joshuawise.com/horndis downloads page and click the link to download the latest binary package. At the time of writing, this link leads to the file <code>HoRNDIS-rel7.pkg</code>, which should be downloaded.

			<img src="onlinehelp/img/horndis_installer_2.png" alt=""/><br/>
			<img src="onlinehelp/img/horndis_installer_3.png" alt=""/>
           </li>
          <li>
            Before the installer can finalize the installation, it will request administrator permissions. Supply the necessary credentials to finish the installation.<br/>
			<img src="onlinehelp/img/horndis_installer_user_authentication.png" alt=""/>
          </li>
          <li>
            A summary of the installation will be shown once it completes.<br/>
			<img src="onlinehelp/img/horndis_installer_summary.png" alt=""/>
          </li>
          <li>
            At this point it is advisable to restart the computer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Connect the MFLI Instrument to the computer using the USB cable and power it up. Wait until the blue LED on the front-panel of the MFLI Instrument illuminates.
          </li>
          <li>
            To verify that the MFLI is correctly detected by the computer open the <em>System Preferences</em> and select the <em>Network</em> category.<br/>

			<img src="onlinehelp/img/verif_horndis_install_2.png" alt=""/><br/>
            The MFLI device should now be shown in the interface list with a green icon and marked as <code>Connected</code>.
              When the interface is selected, the information in the right hand side pane should update to show that the interface
              uses DHCP and the IP address should take the form <code>192.168.x.x</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is now possible to connect to the device using a web browser either by entering
            the following in the address bar:<br/>
            <code>&lt;instrument-serial>.local</code><br/>
            where<code>&lt;instrument-serial></code> is the serial number of the instrument.<br/>
            Alternatively, the IP address of the instrument can be used. The IP address of the
              instrument is the IP address shown in the described in the previous step, with 1 added
              to the right-most octet. So for instance, if the IP address shown is
                <code>192.168.47.57</code>, the instrument IP address to enter in the address bar
              would be <code>192.168.47.58</code>.
          </li>
        </ol>
      <h3 id="ummfli.getting_started.deviceConnectivity.1GbE">Instrument Discovery TCP/IP</h3>
      <p>Various schemes are possible for logically connecting to the MFLI instrument via
        TCP/IP.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          DHCP (the simplest scheme for the user and the default)
        </li>
        <li>
          Static IP (the fallback if DHCP fails)
        </li>
        <li>
          Point to point (P2P)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>DHCP is the simplest and preferred connection method. Other connection methods can become necessary when using
      network configurations that are in contradiction with the local policies.</p>
        <h4>DHCP</h4>
        <p>The most straightforward Ethernet connection method is to rely on a LAN configuration
          to recognize the MFLI Instrument. This is the MFLI Instrument's default configuration. By
          connecting the instrument in a LAN, a dynamic IP address is assigned like any other PC by
          the DHCP server. In case of restricted networks, the network administrator may be required
          to register the instrument on the network by means of the MAC address. The MAC address is
          indicated on the back panel of the instrument.</p>
        <p>If the network configuration does not allow or does not support DHCP,
		  it is necessary to use a static IP setup as
          described below. The MFLI Instrument is configured to accept the IP address from the DHCP
          server, or to fall back to IP address <code>192.168.1.10</code> if it does not obtain one. </p>
        <!-- TODO(JS): Picture multicast discovery -->
        <p>Requirements</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Network supports multicast (especially router)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Static Instrument IP</h4>
        <p>The best way to assign the instrument a static IP address is to first connect via USB.
          This is especially necessary if DHCP is not available in the LAN.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Connect to the instrument via USB and start the LabOne User Interface MFLI USB as described in <a

          </li>
          <li>
            Connect an Ethernet cable from a switch in the LAN to the 1GbE port on the back
              panel of the MFLI Instrument.
          </li>
          <li>
            Power cycle the MFLI instrument.
          </li>
          <li>
            (Optional) To verify the connection between the host computer and the MFLI
              Instrument, open a DOS command window and ping the IP address entered above.
          </li>
          <li>
            Type the following in the address bar of a web browser on a computer within the
              LAN:<br/>
            <code>http://&lt;Static IP Address>/</code><br/>
            where <code>&lt;Static IP Address></code> is the static IP address entered
              above.<br/>
            The LabOne UI should now appear.

        <div class="note">
        <label>Note</label>
          <p>If the MFLI Instrument fails to obtain a dynamic IP address from the DHCP server in

        </div>
        <h4>Point to Point (P2P)</h4>
        <p>Setting up a point-to-point network consisting only of the host computer and the MFLI avoids problems related
        to special network policies. Since it is nonetheless necessary to stay connected to the internet, it is
        recommended to install two network cards in your computer, one of them for network connectivity, the second one
        for connecting to the MFLI Instrument. Notebooks can generally profit from wireless LAN for internet connection.

      <h2 id="laboneseparatePC">Running the LabOne Web Server on a Separate PC</h2>
      <p>
        By default both the LabOne Web Server and the Data Server run on the embedded PC in the instrument. It can be
        advantageous to run the LabOne Web Server on a separate PC. This is particularly the case when using high data
        transfer rates. The higher processing power of laptop and desktop computers then gives improved UI
        responsiveness and generally a better user experience and reduces the probability of data loss.
      </p>
      <p>
        To run the Web Server on a separate PC, the LabOne software must be installed on that PC. See <a
        href="#ummfli.getting_started.labOneInstallation">Installing the LabOne Software on a PC</a> for LabOne
        installation instructions.
      </p>

      </figure>
        <h3>Connecting to the MFLI from the Web Server</h3>
        <p>Once the LabOne software has been installed on a separate PC, proceed as follows to connect to the MFLI Instrument:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Start the LabOne Web Server. From the Windows <em>Start</em> menu,
            select <code>All Programs &#8594; Zurich Instruments &#8594; LabOne Servers &#8594;
              LabOne Web Server</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the LabOne DataServer Connect dialog that appears, type the following text in the Host Name field:<br/>
            <code>&lt;instrument-serial>.&lt;domain></code><br/>
            Where <code>&lt;instrument-serial></code> is the serial number of the MFLI
            Instrument and <code>&lt;domain></code> is the network domain in which the instrument is
            running. An example is given below.<br/>
                 <img src="onlinehelp/img/data_server_connect.png" alt=""/><br/>
            The port to use is 8004 which by default should already be correct (The
              LabOne Data Server running on the MFLI listens on port 8004).
          </li>
          <li>
            Click the <em>Connect</em> button. The Device and Settings dialog will
              appear allowing you to proceed as normal.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p> This setting can be made permanent by making a copy of the LabOne WebServer shortcut and modifying its properties. Proceed as follows (this is the procedure for Windows 7):</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Copy the LabOne Web Server shortcut to the desktop (from the <em>Start</em> menu, navigate to
              <code>All Programs &#8594; Zurich Instruments &#8594; LabOne Servers &#8594; LabOne
              Web Server</code> and use CTRL and drag and drop).
          </li>
          <li>
            Right click the copied Desktop shortcut and select <em>Properties</em> to bring up the Properties dialog.
          </li>
          <li>
            Append the following text to the text in the Target field and click <em>OK</em>:<br/>
            <code>--server-ip &lt;instrument-serial></code><br/>
            Where <code>instrument-serial></code> is the serial number of the MFLI Instrument. See example below.<br/>
                <img src="onlinehelp/img/web_server_properties.png" alt=""/>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>When the LabOne Web server is now started using this icon, it will automatically connect to the Data Server running
        on the MFLI Instrument.</p>
        <div class="note">
		<label>Note</label>
          <p>A LabOne Web Server running on a separate PC listens only on IP port 8006. Port 80 is not used to prevent conflicts with other applications running on the PC.</p>
        </div>
      <h2>Using the LabOne Programming APIs</h2>
      <p>The LabOne software provides Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for MATLAB, LabVIEW, Python and C. To use
      these APIs requires further installation steps. See the next sections.</p>
      <figure id="ummfli.getting_started.api_on_separate_pc">
            <img src="onlinehelp/img/labone_api_separate_pc.svg" alt="LabOne APIs installed on separate PC"/>
        <figcaption>LabOne APIs installed on separate PC</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The LabOne APIs communicate directly with the Data Server running on the MFLI Instrument via IP port 8004.</p>
	  <p>The device address can be <code>&lt;instrument-serial></code>, <code>mf-&lt;instrument-serial></code>,
	  <code>mf-&lt;instrument-serial>&lt;domain></code>, or <code>&lt;IP address></code>. If the address is not fully qualified,
	  means domain name is not added, the API will perform a network discovery with multicast to get the IP address. This ensures
	  that devices connected by Ethernet over USB will be accessible by the same method as devices connected to LAN.</p>
      <h3>Using the LabOne MATLAB, LabVIEW and C APIs</h3>
      <p>If you want to program the instrument using the LabOne MATLAB, LabVIEW or C programming
        APIs, the LabOne software must be installed on the PC that connects to the instrument. See
          <a href="#ummfli.getting_started.labOneInstallation">Installing the LabOne Software on a PC</a> for LabOne installation
        instructions.</p>
      <p>Please refer to the LabOne Programming Manual for details on using the MATLAB, LabVIEW and
        C APIs.</p>
      <h3>Using the LabOne Python API</h3>
      <p>To use the Python API, the Zurich Instruments LabOne Python package must installed.
        Please refer to the MFLI Programming Manual for the LabOne Python installation and
        programming instructions.</p>
    <h2 id="ummfli.getting_started.labOneInstallation">Installing and Updating the LabOne Software</h2>
    <p> The MFLI Instrument comes with the LabOne software preinstalled and is ready to work out
      of the box. However, the LabOne software can be installed on any PC. This can be advantageous
      for performance reasons and is necessary if programming the instrument using the MATLAB,
      LabVIEW or C APIs.</p>

      <h3>Linux LabOne Installation</h3>
        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <p> Ensure that the following requirements are fulfilled before trying to install the
          LabOne software package: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Officially, only Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (i386, amd64) is supported although in practice
              the LabOne package may work on other platforms. Please ensure that you are using a
              Linux distribution that is compatible with Ubuntu/Debian, but preferably Ubuntu 12.04
              LTS.
          </li>
          <li>
            You have administrator rights for the system.
          </li>
          <li>
            The correct version of the LabOne installation package for your operating system
              and platform have been downloaded from the Zurich Instruments http://www.zhinst.com/downloads downloads page (login required):
            <ul>
              <li>
                LabOneLinux&lt;arch>-&lt;release>.&lt;revision>.tar.gz, for example:<br/>
                <code>LabOneLinux32/64-XX.XX.XXXXX.tar.gz</code>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p> Please ensure you download the correct architecture (32-bit/64-bit) of the LabOne
              installer. The <code>uname</code> command can be used in order to determine which
              architecture you are using, by running: </p>
            <code>uname -m</code>
            <p> in a command line terminal. If the command outputs &quot;<code>x686</code>&quot;
              the 32-bit version of the LabOne package is required, if it displays
                &quot;<code>x86_64</code>&quot; the 64-bit version is required. </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Linux LabOne Installation</h3>
        <p> Proceed with the installation in a command line shell as follows: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Extract the LabOne tarball in a temporary directory:
            <code>tar xzvf LabOneLinux&lt;arch>-&lt;release>-&lt;revision>.tar.gz</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Navigate into the extracted directory.
            <code>cd LabOneLinux&lt;arch>-&lt;release>-&lt;revision></code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Run the install script with administrator rights and proceed through the guided
              installation, using the default installation path if possible:
            <code>sudo bash install.sh</code>
            The install script lets you choose between the following three modes:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Type &quot;a&quot; to install the Data Server program, the Web Server program,
                  documentation and APIs.
              </li>
              <li>
                Type &quot;u&quot; to install <code>udev</code> support (only necessary if HF2
                  Instruments will be used with this LabOne installation and not relevant for the
                  MFLI Lock-in Amplifier).
              </li>
              <li>
                Type &quot;ENTER&quot; to install both options &quot;a&quot; and
                  &quot;u&quot;.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Test the installation by starting the Web Server:<br/>
            <code>startWebServerUHF</code><br/>
            and entering the address <code>127.0.0.1:8006</code> in a web browser to start the
              LabOne User Interface. The LabOne Web Server installed on the PC listens by default on
              port number 8006 instead of 80 to minimize the probability of conflicts.<br/>
            In the LabOne DataServer Connect dialog that appears, type the following text in the Host Name field:<br/>
            <code>&lt;instrument-serial>.&lt;domain></code><br/>
            Where <code>&lt;instrument-serial></code> is the serial number of the MFLI
              Instrument and <code>&lt;domain></code> is the network domain in which the instrument is
              running. An example is given below.<br/>
                <img src="onlinehelp/img/data_server_connect.png" alt=""/><br/>
             The port to use is 8004 which by default should already be correct (The
              LabOne Data Server running on the MFLI listens on port 8004).<br/>
            Click the <em>Connect</em> button. The Device and Settings dialog will
              appear allowing you to proceed as normal.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Uninstalling LabOne on Linux</h3>
        <p> The LabOne software package copies an uninstall script to the base installation path
          (the default installation directory is <code>/opt/zi/</code>). To uninstall the LabOne
          package please perform the following steps in a command line shell: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Navigate to the path where LabOne is installed, for example, if LabOne is
              installed in the default installation path: <br/>
            <code>cd /opt/zi/</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Run the uninstall script with administrator rights and proceed through the guided
              steps: <br/>
              <code>sudo bash uninstall_LabOne&lt;arch>-&lt;release>-&lt;revison>.sh</code>
          </li>
        </ol>
